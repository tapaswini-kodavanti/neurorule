# This is a minimal subset of the options available for Pylint.
# To generate an exhaustive configuration file based on current settings and defaults, run the following command

# Add files or directories to the blacklist. They should be base names, not
# paths.

# Add files or directories matching the regex patterns to the blacklist. The
# regex matches against base names, not paths.

# Use multiple processes to speed up Pylint. Specifying 0 will auto-detect the

# When enabled, pylint would attempt to guess common misconfiguration and emit

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"
