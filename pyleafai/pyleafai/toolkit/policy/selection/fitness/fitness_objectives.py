class FitnessObjectives():
    '''
    Data class which keeps track of all the Fitness Objective data for
    an experiment.

    The idea behind this class is that this guy:

    1. Parses fitness information from common injected properties
    2. Centralizes the access to fitness information
    3. Is dependency injected into other policy classes' constructors
       as this information is needed.
    4. Provides ranking Comparators for each fitness objective.
       Ranking comparators put more-fit Individuals closer to the start
       of a list sorted by them, and less-fit Individuals closer to the end.
       (Note that this is the reverse of what most folks might expect
        out of a Comparator, but tends to be the most useful for selection.)

    In general we expect a single instance of this class to be provided to
    all consumers of this information for any single scope of evolution.
    (Meaning coevolution might have > 1)
